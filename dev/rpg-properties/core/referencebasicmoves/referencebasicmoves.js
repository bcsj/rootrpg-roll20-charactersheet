  "Attempt a Roguish Feat": {
    "text": "When you **attempt a roguish feat you are skilled in**, say your goal and roll with Finesse. On a hit, you achieve your goal. On a 7-9, mark exhaustion or one risk of your feat (GM's choice) comes to bear. When you attempt a roguish feat you are NOT skilled in, you are **trusting fate**.",
    "mastery": "On a 12+, in addition to the results of a 10+, choose one:\n* immediately accomplish a second appropriate roguish feat, whether or not you possess that feat, as if you had rolled a 10+\n* clear 2-exhaustion as you exert control over yourself and the situation\n"

  "Figure Someone Out": {
    "text": "When you **try to figure someone out**, roll with Charm. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7-9, hold 1. While interacting with them, spend your hold 1 for 1 to ask their player a question:\n\n* is your character telling the truth?\n* what is your character really feeling?\n* what does your character intend to do?\n* what does your character wish I'd do?\n* how could I get your character to _______?\n",
    "mastery": "On a 12+, in addition to the results of the 10+, mark down their name on your character sheet; from this point forward, you can always tell if they are lying to you. If you roll a 12+ against a character whose name you have already marked down, you instead take +1 ongoing to act on the answers to the questions you ask."
  },
  "Persuade an NPC": {
    "text": "When you **persuade an NPC with promises or threats**, roll with Charm. On a 10+, they see things your way, provided you have given them a strong motive or reasonable bribe. On a 7-9, they aren't sure; the GM will tell you what you need to do to sway them.\n",
    "mastery": "On a 12+, in addition to the results of the 10+, you may mark exhaustion to treat this move as a 12+ on the **sway an NPC** Reputation move, even if you don't have a high enough Reputation with their faction to normally **sway the NPC** in question."
  },
  "Read a Tense Situation": {
    "text": "When you **read a tense situation**, roll with Cunning. On a 7-9, ask 1. On a 10+, ask 3. Take +1 when acting on the answers.\n\n* what's my best way out / in / through?\n* who or what is the biggest threat?\n* who or what is most vulnerable to me?\n* what should I be on the lookout for?\n* who is in control here?\n",
    "mastery": "On a 12+, in addition to the results of the 10+, you may also ask, \"How could I _?\" and fill in the blank with any action you hope to accomplish. If you follow the answer to that question, take a 12+ on the first move you make toward your desired outcome, instead of rolling."
  },
  "Trick an NPC": {
    "text": "When you **trick an NPC** to get what you want, roll with Cunning. On a hit, they take the bait and do what you want. On a 7-9, they can instead choose one:\n\n* they hesitate; you shake their confidence or weaken their morale.\n* they stumble; you gain a critical opportunity.\n* they overreact; take +1 forward against them.\n",
    "mastery": "On a 12+, they buy into your deception utterly and entirely; it would take obvious, incontrovertible evidence to shake their belief. You can always return to the same character and play up the same **trick** again, taking a 10+ to trick them the same way instead of rolling."
  },
  "Trust Fate": {
    "text": "When you **trust fate** to get through trouble, roll with Luck. On a hit you scrape by or barrel through; the GM will tell you what it costs you. On a 10+, fortune favors the bold; your panache also earns you a fleeting opportunity.\n",
    "mastery": "On a 12+, fate smiles upon you as you receive an incredible and surprising windfall of luck. You accomplish your aim without cost, and you receive an immediate fortunate benefit; the GM will tell you what bounty befalls you."
  },
  "Wreck Something": {
    "text": "When you **wreck something**, roll with Might. On a hit, you seriously break it; it can't be used again until it's repaired. On a 7-9, you're imprecise and dangerous; you cause collateral damage, attract attention, or end up in a bad spot, GM's choice.\n",
    "mastery": "On a 12+, in addition to the results of the 10+, choose one from the list:\n\n* inflict 2-injury on any foes in the area (from splinters, debris, falling infrastructure, etc.)\n* you break, smash, or destroy something far larger and more substantial than you normally could (an entire building, a mountain face, etc.)\n* you can grab up shards of useful material from the wreckage; clear 2-depletion\n"
  },
  "Help or Interfere": {
    "text": "When you **help or interfere** with another vagabond, mark exhaustion to add +1 or -2 to their roll (after rolling). Mark exhaustion again to select one of the following:\n\n* conceal your aid or interference\n* create an opportunity or obstacle\n"
  },
  "Plead with a PC": {
    "text": "When you **plead with a PC** to go along with you, they clear 1-exhaustion if they agree to what you've proposed. You may use this move only once per session.\n"
